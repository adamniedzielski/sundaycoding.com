      Codebase Health Check
    </h1>

    <p>When did you last check the health of your codebase? How often do you think about the code quality of your web application? Do you have time to step back and consider the bigger picture?<p>

    <p>If your answers are: "yesterday morning", "twice a week" and "yes" then congratulations! You are among the 1% of the software industry and you can safely close this window - you don't need our help. But if your answers are different - read on!</p>

    <p>We have a solution for you - Codebase Health Check of your entire Ruby on Rails application. What is Codebase Health Check? Codebase Health Check is the detailed code quality report created just for you.</p>

    <h2>
      Why do I need a code quality report?
    </h2>

    <p>
      People don't discuss the clean code practices for the sake of esthetics. The code is written to deliver the business value. Low quality code will slow down the future growth. It negatively impacts the ability to implement new features. It increases the cost of maintaining the software. Bad code costs you a lot of money! 
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, it's really hard to think about the wider perspective when the new features are what matters most NOW. Fortunately, there are external experts who can do it for you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Codebase Health Check is your unique chance to get a second opinion on the quality of your code. It's a fresh look from the person who wasn't involved in writing the code. The report allows you to estimate the state of code quality in your project. It contains practical tips and suggestion what should be improved.
